cs305 Software Security SNHU

Attached in the CS 305 Project Two Template is a secure software report I created for Artemis Financial.
Artemis Financial is a financial services company that creates individualized financial plans, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. As part of their initiative to modernize operations, Artemis Financial sought Global Rain’s expertise in implementing advanced software security for their web application. The company is focused on protecting sensitive client data and financial information, and they needed to enhance their software with secure communication mechanisms.
When identifying vulnerabilities in Artemis Financial's software, I focused on enhancing security protocols to meet their specific requirements. I successfully implemented AES-256 encryption for secure data handling, upgraded outdated libraries, and ensured that data transmissions were encrypted using HTTPS. The addition of SHA-256 checksums for file integrity further strengthened the software’s defenses, ensuring a reliable solution for verifying the integrity of transferred data. Software security is essential for protecting sensitive customer data and maintaining the trust of clients. By employing secure coding practices, I helped reduce the risk of potential cyberattacks, ensuring that Artemis Financial’s web application remains resilient against evolving threats.
The vulnerability assessment was particularly challenging due to the need to address issues in the Spring Framework and Tomcat components, which persisted despite updates. 
To increase security, I implemented multiple layers, including AES-256 encryption with Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) for confidentiality and integrity, enforced HTTPS for secure communication, and validated SHA-256 checksums to ensure data integrity. These measures helped build a defense-in-depth approach.
I employed a rigorous testing process to ensure that the refactored code did not introduce new vulnerabilities. This process included using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check and static code analysis. The libraries and components were updated to ensure they met current security standards, reducing the risk of outdated vulnerabilities.
For future projects, I will continue using secure libraries, frameworks, and tools, including AES encryption and OWASP Dependency-Check.Additionally, following NIST guidelines for patch management and validating new libraries against known vulnerabilities is essential for maintaining secure software development practices. Throughout the project, I applied industry-standard best practices such as upgrading vulnerable components, selectively suppressing false positives after careful verification, and ensuring secure communication via HTTPS.
This project highlights my ability to integrate security protocols, refactor code, and implement encryption practices to enhance software security. The experience gained will be valuable in future roles requiring expertise in secure software development, vulnerability assessments, and cryptography.
